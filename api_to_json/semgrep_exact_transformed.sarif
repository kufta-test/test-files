In Go, it is possible to use the `exec.Command` function in combination with the `bash -c` command to run the user input as a shell command. To sanitize the user input, you can use a library like `shellescape` to escape any special characters before constructing the command.

An attacker can execute arbitrary commands, potentially gaining complete control of the system. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid executing OS commands with user input. If this is unavoidable, validate and sanitize the input, and use safe methods for executing the commands. In Go, it is possible to use the `exec.Command` function in combination with the `bash -c` command to run the user input as a shell command. To sanitize the user input, you can use a library like `shellescape` to escape any special characters before constructing the command.
